# statelib
State in javascript, again.

This is a workspace of my thoughts on a fully generalized state/data management interface.

The "BS" folders are my working thoughts thrown into an archive, only "SRC" is the current idea.

## Goals

- A generalized state/data management interface that can connect to various backends.
- Support reactive/event driven/subscriptions
- Support collabrative data sources like Y.JS
- Support REST and GraphQL data sources
- Support new lit controller for easy updating of lit-elements
